This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## In short

This app is, initially, a build-along project to accompany a udemy course. I intend to make some opinionated divergences later in its development, but for now, I'm using it to satisfy some learning objectives.

## Aforementioned 'learning objectives'

- TypeScript, specifically in conjunction with React and Redux
- Browser-based code execution
- basics of WASM
- browser caching using Indexed DB
- Likely, much more
